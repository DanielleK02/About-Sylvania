      <h1>History</h1>
      <h3>Behind the City of Trees</h3>
	   <p>We have all pondered the question... How did Sylvania get called the <i>"City of Trees"</i>. Sylvania got this 
		reputation because there were dense forests that covered the city. Now, for over 20 years Sylvania has got the 
		national award of <i>"Tree City USA"</i>.
		</p>
	   <h3>The Lathrop House</h3>
	  <p>The Lathrop's were a family that moved to Sylvania in 1848, which many came to them to seek shelter and run from 
		slavery. Back then housing/harboring slaves that ran away was illegal. However, that did not stop the Lathrop's 
		from helping those runaways. Their house was one of many different places that became apart of escape routes for
		slaves to take. In their house they made a secret space for slaves to stay in at their house. This space was not found 
		until 1939 due to a remodel with a new houseowner.</p>
